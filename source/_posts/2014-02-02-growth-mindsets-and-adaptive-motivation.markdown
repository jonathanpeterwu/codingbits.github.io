Adaptive motivation and growth mindset
--------------------------------------

Fixed Mindset - see situations and the world as unchangeable, DNA, NATURE over NURTURE.. they approach adversity in one way.
1) adversity
2) reasoning
3) depression
4) reasoning - recovery end… 

Growth Mindset - believe and adhere to a life of growth, changing behaviors, patterns, and ways of thinking. NURTURE over NATURE, the approach adversity as a learning experience
1) adversity
2) reason
3) depression
4) reasoning
5) plan of attack - make it vivid
6) implement it

>“So the idea is not only to make a growth-mindset plan, but also to visualize, in a concrete way, how you’re going to carry it ”

Cultivating a growth mindset in others

Ask probing questions, when someone is a fixed mindset, "i can't lose weight", talk about how you might approach losing the weight

>“What did you learn today?” “What mistake did you make that taught you something?” “What did you try hard at today?”

Willpower
---------
Willpower is not a fixed thing, someone doesn't have more than you do. Instead other people have strategies and concepts to remove the need for "willpower" to make decisions

>“Next time you try to diet, think of Nathan and remember that willpower is not just a thing you have or don’t have. Willpower needs help. I’ll come back to this point.”

Seeing and Living a Growth Mindset
----------------------------------
To live the growth mindset is to believe in the philosophy of growth, lear and help others learn, things can be changed

>“Change to a growth mindset, they change from a judge-and-be-judged framework to a learn-and-help-learn framework”
